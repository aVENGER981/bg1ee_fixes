    <b>Game Behavior at Present</b>
    <p>Barbarian Rage is imposing a -2 penalty to saves against spells. Sleep and stun immunities are not documented in the kit description. This ability does not suppress the portrait icons, visual animations and strings for all effects that it protects against (chaos, charm, confusion, fear, hold, level drain, rigid thinking, sleep, stun). Barbarian Rage isn't flagged as a non-magical ability which makes it possible for Dead/Wild Magic zones to affect it.</p>
    <b>Correct Game Behavior</b>
    <p>Barbarian Rage should grant a +2 bonus to saves against spells. Sleep and stun immunities should be documented in the kit description. This ability should suppress the portrait icons, visual animations and strings for all effects that it protects against (chaos, charm, confusion, fear, hold, level drain, rigid thinking, sleep, stun). Barbarian Rage should be flagged as a non-magical ability in order to prevent Dead/Wild Magic zones from affecting it.</p>

    <p>At levels 6-8, monks are receiving a spurious +1 THAC0 bonus. They are missing 1 point of damage and THAC0 at levels 15-17. The 'fist' items that give monks their unarmed attacks are unnamed.</p>
    <b>Correct Game Behavior</b>
    <p>At levels 6-8, monks should not be receiving a spurious +1 THAC0 bonus. They should receive an additonal point of THAC0 and damage at levels 15-17. The 'fist' items that give monks their unarmed attacks should be named as such.</p>
