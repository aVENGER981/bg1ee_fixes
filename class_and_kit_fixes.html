<p>The bugfixes listed below apply to the core classes of Baldur's Gate 2.</p>
<h3>General Class Fixes</h3>
<h4>Weapon Proficiency Fixes </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>There are a few errors with classes being unable to put the correct amount of points in certain weapon proficiencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fighter-Mage-Clerics and Cleric-Rangers  can only put 1 point in Two-Handed Weapon Style</li>
  <li>Fighter-Mage-Clerics and Cleric-Rangers  can  put 3 points in clubs</li>
  <li>Fighter-Druids, Fighter-Mage-Clerics and Cleric-Rangers can only put 2 points in Two Weapon Style</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fighter-Mage-Clerics and Cleric-Rangers should be able to put 2 points in Two-Handed Weapon Style</li>
  <li>Fighter-Mage-Clerics and Cleric-Rangers  should only be able to put 2 points in clubs</li>
  <li>Fighter-Druids, Fighter-Mage-Clerics and Cleric-Rangers should be able to put 3 points in Two Weapon Style</li>
</ul>

<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<h4>Barbarian Rage </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>Barbarian Rage is imposing a -2 penalty to saves against spells. Sleep and stun immunities are not documented in the kit description. This ability does not suppress the portrait icons, visual animations and strings for all effects that it protects against (chaos, charm, confusion, fear, hold, level drain, rigid thinking, sleep, stun). Barbarian Rage isn't flagged as a non-magical ability which makes it possible for Dead/Wild Magic zones to affect it.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>Barbarian Rage should grant a +2 bonus to saves against spells. Sleep and stun immunities should be documented in the kit description. This ability should suppress the portrait icons, visual animations and strings for all effects that it protects against (chaos, charm, confusion, fear, hold, level drain, rigid thinking, sleep, stun). Barbarian Rage should be flagged as a non-magical ability in order to prevent Dead/Wild Magic zones from affecting it.</p>
<p><i>Files altered: spcl152.spl</i></p>
<h4> Movement Bonus </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>The innate movement bonus that Barbarians receive could be negated by spell effects such as free action.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>The innate movement bonus that Barbarians receive should not be negated by spell effects such as free action.</p>
<p><i>Files altered: spcl151.spl</i>
</p>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<h4>Movement Bonus </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>The innate movement bonus that Monks receive could be negated by spell effects such as free action. A monk under the effects of free action when leveling up could miss their speed boost permanently.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>The innate movement bonus that Monks receive should not be negated by spell effects such as free action. A monk under the effects of free action when leveling up should not miss their speed boost.</p>
<p><i>Files altered: spcl812.spl, spcl813.spl</i> </p>
<h4>Unarmed attack THAC0 and damage values </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>At levels 6-8, monks are receiving a spurious +1 THAC0 bonus. They are missing 1 point of damage and THAC0 at levels 15-17. The 'fist' items that give monks their unarmed attacks are unnamed.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>At levels 6-8, monks should not be receiving a spurious +1 THAC0 bonus. They should receive an additonal point of THAC0 and damage at levels 15-17. The 'fist' items that give monks their unarmed attacks should be named as such.</p>

</p>
<h3>Thieves</h3>
<h4>Multi-and Dual-Class Thieves Restricted from Lawful Neutral and Lawful Evil
  Alignments </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong> </p>
<p>Single-class thieves are allowed to be of lawful neutral and lawful evil alignments,
but their multi- and dual-class versions are not.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Alignment requirements should be the same for single-, dual-, and multi-class thieves; specifically lawful neutral and lawful evil should be allowed alignments for all thieves.</p>
<p><em>Files altered: </em>alignmnt.2da</p>
<h4>Very Low Dexterity Characters Not Receiving Penalties to Thieving Abilities</h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong></p>
<p>Thieves with a dexterity score lower than 9 do not receive penalties to their abilities (pick pockets, stealth, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong></p>
<p>Impose penalties for low dexterity by extending the dexterity table for values of 1-8.</p>
<p><em>Files altered: </em>skilldex.2da</p>
<h2>Kit Fixes</h2>
<p>The bugfixes listed below apply to the various kits of Baldur's Gate 2.</p>
<h3>General Kit Fixes</h3>
<h4>Proper kit detection </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>Due to several errors in the <strong>kit.ids</strong> table, many dialogues and scripts that check, for example, whether the player is a Berserker or a Morninglord of Lathander fail. In general, this manifests itself mainly in the form of dialogue not being specific to a player's kit, or missing dialogue options for special kits</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>kit.ids</strong> table needs to be corrected in this manner. Furthermore, various joinable NPCs also need to be updated with the corrected kit values.</p>
<p><i>Files altered: kit.ids, anomen6.cre, anomen7.cre, anomen8.cre, anomen9.cre, anomen10.cre, anomen12.cre, imoen.cre, imoen6.cre, imoen10.cre, imoen15.cre, imoen211.cre, imoen213.cre, haer10.cre, haer11.cre, haer13.cre, haer15.cre, haer19.cre, korgan8.cre, korgan9.cre, korgan11.cre, korgan12.cre, korgan15.cre, mazzy8.cre, mazzy9.cre, mazzy11.cre, mazzy12.cre, mazzy15.cre</i></p>
<h4>Kit proficency corrections</h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong> </p>
<p>Several kits have small errors in their available proficencies</p>
<ul>
  <li>Swashbucklers are allowed one star in katanas</li>
  <li>Monks are not allowed to place any stars in katanas</li>
  <li>Swashbucklers are allowed two stars in crossbows, slings, and shortbows</li>
  <li>Kensais and Cavaliers are allowed dart proficiencies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Swashbucklers should be able to place two stars in katanas</li>
  <li>Monks should be allowed one star in katanas</li>
  <li>Swashbucklers should be limited to one star  in crossbows, slings, and shortbows</li>
  <li>Kensais and Cavaliers should not be allowed any proficiency in darts</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Files altered: </em>weapprof.2da</p>
<h3>Berserker</h3>
<h4>Enrage </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>Berserker enrage is not actually protecting against stun, despite it being in the description of the ability. Enrage provides immunities to confusion, level drain, and feeblemind but these are not documented. While in the 'cool down' period, a THAC0 penalty is being applied but it's not reflected in the character sheet. The cool down is also using the same name as the actual enrage ability, implying enrage had been cast when it was ending. Enrage does not suppress the portrait icons, visual animations and strings for all effects that it protects against (chaos, charm, confusion, fear, hold, level drain, rigid thinking, sleep, stun). The 'fatigue' ability resulting from being enraged isn't flagged as a non-magical ability which makes it possible for Dead/Wild Magic zones to affect it.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>Berserker enrage should protect against stun, as per the description. The immunities to confusion, level drain, and feeblemind should be documented in the kit's description. The THAC0 penalty applied during the 'cool down' period should show up in the character sheet. The cool down should not be using the same name as the actual enrage ability. Enrage should suppress the portrait icons, visual animations and strings for all effects that it protects against (chaos, charm, confusion, fear, hold, level drain, rigid thinking, sleep, stun). The 'fatigue' ability resulting from being enraged should be flagged as a non-magical ability in order to prevent Dead/Wild Magic zones from affecting it.</p>

</p>
<h3>Kensai</h3>
<h4>Weapon Speed Bonus </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>The weapon speed bonus isn't applied correctly as the application method assumes that opcode #190 is cumulative with itself (which it isn't).</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>The weapon speed bonus should be applied correctly and in accordance to the character's level, as per the kit description. This can be accomplished by adding multiple headers to spcl143.spl which can then be used apply the proper weapon speed bonuses at the corresponding levels.</p>
<p><i>Files altered: spcl143.spl</i>
</p>
<h3>Wizard Slayer</h3>
<h4>Spell failure not applying to ranged attacks </h4>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong>
</p>
<p>The original kit description of the Wizard Slayer states as a kit advantage: &quot;For each successful hit on an opponent, 10% cumulative spell failure penalty is applied&quot;. However, it is only applying this effect on melee hits.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>Either let the spell failure apply to ranged attacks as well or update the kit description in order to make it clear that it only works for melee weapons.</p>
<p><i>Files altered: spcl133.spl</i>
</p>
<h3>Skald</h3>
<p><strong>Game Behavior at Present</strong> </p>
<p>Skalds are supposed to receive +1 to damage and <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>,
but were only receiving the damage bonus. </p>
<p><strong>Correct Game Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Add the +1 THAC0 bonus.</p>
